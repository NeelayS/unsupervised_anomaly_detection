# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Chest Radiographs

Implementation of [Unsupervised Deep Anomaly Detection in Chest Radiographs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-020-00413-2) using PyTorch.

## Steps to reproduce -

- Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/rules) and extract it to the `data` directory.
- Switch to the `data` directory and run `extract_images.py`. 
```
cd data
python extract_images.py
```
