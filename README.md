## Steps to reproduce -

- Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` or create a conda environment using `environment.yml` and `conda activate anomaly`.
- Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/rules) from Kaggle and extract it to the `data` directory.
- Switch to the `data` directory and run `extract_images.py`. 
```
cd data/
python extract_images.py
```
- Run the `main.py` file from the root directory with appropriate command line arguments.
